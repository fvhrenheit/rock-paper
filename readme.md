I barely understand this bs...
most of the js code is copied, from different places, I managed to stitch this together so that it works somehow.
But I couldn't come up with anything myself, that stuff is hard..
I am doubting myself, that I will ever be able to accomplish anything in programming, shit sucks.

im not pushing this to github, it's not my code anyways.

EDIT: welp, i guess i had to push it since i have to come back to this project haha...
